/*Write a code to take boarding stop and destination stop values as integers, the number of adult
passengers, and a number of child passengers as integers. Then find the number of stops the
passengers are travelling. Calculate Rs.10 per adult passenger per stop. Calculate Rs.5 per child
passenger and then find the cost of the ticket( including adult ticket cost and child ticket cost).
No apply an offer as follows to the ticket.
If No.of adult passengers are &gt;=5 then give a discount of 20% of cost of the ticket.
Else If No.of adult passengers are 4 then give a discount of 15% of cost of the ticket.
Else If No.of adult passengers are 3 then give a discount of 10% of cost of the ticket.
Else If No.of adult passengers are 2 then give a discount of 5% of cost of the ticket.
Else If No.of adult passengers are 1 then give a discount of 0% of cost of the ticket.
Then calculate a 10% tax on the cost of the ticket.
Then find the total price of the ticket including tax.
Then display all the data on the output screen.*/
