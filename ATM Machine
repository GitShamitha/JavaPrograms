/*Write a Code to implement an ATM replica. Assign initial balance Rs.10000, Cash available in Machine Rs.50000, PIN
1234. Write a code to execute the same for an infinite number of times as many times as the user wants.
For every iteration ask the user to enter PIN and verify the PIN. Then display the following options:
1. Balance Enquiry
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. PIN change.
 Check whether the amount is valid or not to perform a deposit operation and display the updated balance
after the deposit operation.
 Perform withdrawal operations by checking multiple conditions and displaying updated balances.
 Ask the user to enter the old PIN number before changing to a new PIN. If the old PIN is valid then ask new
PIN twice to confirm the new PIN.
 After every iteration ask the user to continue. If the user says yes then continue with another iteration
else exit from the program.*/
