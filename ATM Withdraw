/*You are given an Initial account balance of 10000, an ATM pin as 1234, and Cash available in the
machine as 8000. Then Write a code to perform the withdraw operation.
Read the Pin from the use and verify whether it is correct or not.
If correct, read the amount ‘X’ to withdraw.
Check given X is a valid amount or not (multiple of 100).
If X is a valid amount, Check X&lt;=balance.
If Yes, then check X amount is available in the ATM machine or not.
If cash is available then print the updated balance.
Else print Transaction failed.*/
